# Smart_Voting_System
Online Voting web application utilizing face recognition features for authorization of login.

ABSTRACT

In this modern era where everything is being digitalized, A smart voting system which can be utilized by the people without the need for moving out of the house is desired by many. We therefore intend to design a secure web application for simple and hassle-free voting. The project will be developed using Spring framework for the backend, which ensures prevention of unauthorized access to a clientâ€™s account. To help alleviate Electoral Fraud, the system will use a database of registered voters, along with their facial biometric data, to verify their identity before allowing them to vote. The facial recognition system will be responsible for capturing and analysing the facial features of the voter to ensure that they are the same as the ones stored in the database. Once the voter's identity has been verified, they will be allowed to cast their vote using the voting system. This project facilitates creation of two distinct account types, voters and the organizers. Organizers will be provided with a user-friendly interface for creation of polls. Through this project, we hope to deliver a secure and convenient platform for voting.
